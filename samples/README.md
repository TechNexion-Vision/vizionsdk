# VizionSDK Samples

This repository contains three sample projects demonstrating how to use the VizionSDK:

1. **Hello VizionSDK** - Basic setup and initialization
2. **Camera Capture** - Basic camera operations and image capture
3. **Camera Control** - Advanced camera control features

## Prerequisites

Before building and running these projects, ensure you have the following installed:

### CMake (version 3.0 or newer)
- **Windows**: 
  - You can download the latest CMake installer from the [official CMake website](https://cmake.org/download/) and follow the installation instructions provided.
  - Ensure that CMake is added to your system PATH during installation to enable command-line usage.

- **Linux**: 
  - On Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu), you can install CMake using apt:
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install cmake
    ```
  - If sudo apt install cmake is not available. You can manually download and install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) from the official website:

    If you're working with NXP, Nvidia, or TI platforms  look for the Linux aarch64 binary distribution. Download the appropriate tar.gz file for your platform.
    1. Extract the downloaded file:
    ```
    tar -zxvf cmake-[version]-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
    ```
    2. Move the extracted directory:
       - Move the extracted files to a directory like /opt for easier management:
         ```
         sudo mv cmake-[version]-linux-aarch64 /opt/cmake
         ```
    3. Update the PATH environment variable:
       - Add CMake to your system PATH by modifying your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile file:
         ```
          export PATH=/opt/cmake/bin:$PATH
         ```
        - Save the file and reload your profile with
          ```
           source ~/.profile
          ```
### C++ compiler (supporting C++11 standard)

- **Windows**: 
  - For Windows, you might need to install a C++ compiler separately. You can use Microsoft Visual Studio, which includes the MSVC compiler.
    - When installing Visual Studio, make sure to select the "Desktop development with C++" workload during the installation process. This will include the necessary C++ compiler, nmake, and other essential tools for C++ development on Windows. 
  - Alternatively, you can use MinGW, a port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which provides a C++ compiler for Windows.

- **Linux**: 
    - Most Linux distributions come with a C++ compiler pre-installed. However, if it's not available, you can install it using your package manager.
  On Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu), you can install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) using apt:
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential
    ```
   - Embedded systems:
    Embedded systems typically do not require a compiler. Development is done using cross-compilation on a host machine, and the resulting binaries are deployed to the embedded device.

## Building

For each sample (Windows/Linux):

1. Open the terminal/command prompt:
   - Windows: Command Prompt or PowerShell
   - Linux: Your preferred terminal

2. Navigate to the sample directory:  
   e.g., `cd sample1-hello_vizionsdk`

3. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

4. Generate build files using CMake:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

5. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

## Configuring CMakeLists.txt

### When Using System-Installed SDK (.exe or .deb Installed)

If you've installed VizionSDK using the installer (e.g., .exe on Windows or .deb on Linux), you can simply use `find_package`:

```cmake
# Find the SDK package
find_package(vizionsdk REQUIRED)

# Link libraries
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}
  PRIVATE
  vizionsdk::VizionSDK
)
```

### Using Extracted SDK Archive

If you're using the SDK directly from the extracted folder (without system installation), update the path manually:

```cmake
# Set include and lib paths
# NOTE: Adjust the path to match your actual SDK location
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}
  PRIVATE
  <YOUR_SDK_PATH>/include/vizionsdk
)

target_link_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}
  PRIVATE
  <YOUR_SDK_PATH>/lib
)

# Link libraries
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}
  PRIVATE
  VizionSDK
)
```

> üìå Replace `<YOUR_SDK_PATH>` with the actual path to your extracted SDK folder.

---

## Running

After building, you'll find the executable in the `build` directory.  
Run it from the command line or terminal:

- **Windows**:  
  ```bash
  .\hello_vizionsdk.exe
  ```

- **Linux**:  
  ```bash
  ./hello_vizionsdk
  ```

> üîÅ Replace `hello_vizionsdk` with `camera_capture` or `camera_control` depending on the sample you're building.
